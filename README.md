## Welcome
Jasper is a domain experct question answering application using the RAG framework. While learning Jax I found that GPT-4 was not sufficiently knowledgeable to answer my Jax related questions corectly. This left me with the Jax documentation and existing Jax projects as the best tools for learning Jax. My intention in creating Jasper is to provideme with a more efficient interface to glean information from the Jax documentation.

Jax + expert ~= JAXpert ~= Jasper
