- Sveltekit Reactivity and State
    - understanding so far:
        - sveltekit reactively redraws components when the state that component depends on changes
        - this is only triggered on assignment to the variable ex:  count = count + 1
        - this does not happen when a vatiable changes but is still the same object ex: messages.push("new_message)
            - this is not assignment
        - reactive varables can be defined such that they are updated based on the changes to other variables 
            - ex: $: doubled = 2 * count;
            - this is like a use effect in ract
        - can also run abitrary statements reactively, statement is rerun whenever any of the variables it depends on changes
            - ex: $: console.log(`this is count ${count}`)
        - use assignment hot fix to update arrays
            - numbers.push(5); numbers = numbers;
